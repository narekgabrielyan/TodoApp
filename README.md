# To Do MVC

Hello there! This is a "to do" application which can be used to create a simple ToDo list, written in pure js. Enjoy!

## User Guide

1. Create a ToDoApp in your JavaScript code with the following command, passing a reference to the container element as an argument:
    
        const toDoApp = new ToDoApp(containerElement);
2. After declaring your App you can start using it whenever you need, by calling **start** method:

        toDoApp.start();
3. When you are done, delete your app by calling **destroy** method:

        toDoApp.destroy();

### How to use
1. Create a ToDo Item.
2. Create another one :)
3. Mark as checked when you are done
4. Delete if you don't need your ToDo item anymore
5. Filter to see if there are items left
6. Do all your ToDos and have a nice day!
